# Implications
- Use react native to make a mobile version of this app and deploy it in the iOS app store 
- All are welcome to use it! I want to eventually gear it towards the 18 - 30 age range where adulting maybe a new challenge
- Use react.js to remake or complete the application 
- Eventually host using AWS when react.js version is complete, near the same time mobile is deployed
